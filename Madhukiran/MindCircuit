I am passionate about learning DevOps, and I believe Mind Circuit is the right place to build strong practical skills. I want to gain hands-on experience in CI/CD pipelines, automation, cloud technologies, and containerization. I am highly motivated to master DevOps tools and workflows to become industry-ready.
