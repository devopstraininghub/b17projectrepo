PULL REQUEST:

A pull request (PR) is a method for contributing changes to a repository.
It allows developers to request that changes made in a branch be merged into another branch,
typically the main branch. Pull requests provide a platform for code review, discussion, and collaboration, 
ensuring that the code meets the project’s standards before being merged.
